### Sponsors

We're very proud to be organizing the Python for Good conference. This conference, to our knowledge, is the first and currently only conference of this kind for the Python programming language ever. We are bringing together Pythonistas to learn, teach, and work on civic and open source projects.


###### Why Sponsor?

By the very nature of our conference, our attendees are some of the most passionate, connected, and involved in the Code community. For companies looking to hire this is an excellent opportunity to meet and interact professionally and socially with prospective candidates. By sponsoring you are showing your commitment to your community, open source, and the Code community.
