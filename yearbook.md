### Projects

Here’s a list of the organizations and projects we’ve been able to help over the past years making the world a gooder place — if you have a great idea for a future project, let us know and <a href="/submit-project.html">suggest a project</a>.

#### 2016

 In 2016, Python for Good was held in Front Royal, Virgina at [George Mason University’s Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation](http://smconservation.gmu.edu/).

##### Portland Diaper Bank

There are 150,000 children living in poverty in Oregon whose parents often have to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding their children and putting diapers on them. The great people at the Portland Diaper Bank are helping and need our help to do the great work that they do! [More about the Portland Diaper Bank](http://www.pdxdiaperbank.org/).

The application we developed was to replace the existing inventory system to provide better data on their operations. The intake process is volunteer-driven but very time-consuming, and the hours spent doing intake of donations is time they can't spend doing other work. The organization had requested intake methods other than hand-counting, such as barcode scanning or using a scale to weight large volume of loose product. We were able to get barcode intake functioning, and have plans to work in some kind of rudimentary scale-assistant as well.

##### Smithsonian Studying the Scimitar Oryx

Let's be honest, we all want to do great things. What is better than being part of a group that is helping to bring a species that is extinct in the wild back? There are captive populations of the oryx on ranches in Texas that researchers need some help with. They need a centralized database to keep track of the oryx, things like numbers, breeding history (can't let them get inbred), and so on. Once a stable gene pool and other information can be established, researchers are hoping to re-introduce them into the wild!

##### Smithsonian Logging the Loggerhead

There is only one Shrike native to North America and it is a surprisingly important part of the ecosystem. While they were once extremely common throughout the eastern US and Canada, no other bird species has seen their populations reduced as much since the 1960s. The Conservation Centers for Species Survival needs an application to serve as a central repository for researchers in Canada, the US and Mexico to log their research. How amazing would it be to be part of research that may prevent this amazing animal from going extinct?

##### Smithsonian Red Pandas

The red panda researchers are currently using a mish-mash of methods for recording notes and pictures on the state of the red pandas. They need something centralized and accessible by other people. They'd also ideally like the application to work well on tablets since when they are out with the red pandas they use tablets to record their notes.

##### Working Landscapes

The amazing people at the Virginia Working Landscapes have done all the heavy lifting creating wildlife surveys, and now need somewhere to house their information. Virginia Working Landscapes works with partner land-owners throughout the state in numerous watershed zones and organizes teams of citizen scientists to record wetland data. This data is invaluable for state conservation efforts but the current process Virginia Working Landscapes uses to collect and collate that data is slowing down important research. They need an application to record their findings, keep their data organized, and simplify generating accurate reports.

##### NOLA Habitat Humanity

As software developers we have it pretty good and and housing isn't a concern for us. Unfortunately, not everyone is as lucky, especially the people of New Orleans. Despite hurricane Katrina happening about a decade ago, there are still a lot of displaced people in temporary residences who need somewhere to call home. The amazing people at habitat for humanity are trying to fix this with their work in New Orleans 9th ward (one of the hardest hit areas by Katrina) and with a recent grant they received their work is only going to move quicker. The problem is, one of the requirements of the grant is a stricter recording and reporting process of their 300 or so daily volunteers which is where we come in! Let's help them with the great work they are doing by making this process faster so they have more time to rebuilding people's lives.

##### Share Your Christmas

It is an unfortunate reality that not every child has presents under their Christmas tree. The amazing people at the Durham Volunteer Center have a program, Share your Christmas, that matches needy children up with people able to ensure they have something special under their tree. They need a new app to facilitate their process of matching donors and receivers. Ideally they would also like to have it generic enough to also work for thanksgiving (turkeys) and the start of the school year (backpacks full of school supplies for kids.) Even though their current process is extremely terrible, other cities have expressed interest in this so this group will potentially be helping kids from all over the country!

##### Manjia

Manjia was born out of disappointment over the amount of food waste created each year that goes unrecovered. We know there are people in desperate need of food donations and that there are also a lot of people with a surplus of food. We believe that by providing a simple way for people from those two groups to be connected it will significantly reduce the amount of food wasted. As sustainability becomes more and more a topic of conversation we hope that food recycling can be discussed as one of the easiest ways to improve the lives of those in need while at the same time lessening our impact on the world by reducing landfill waste.
