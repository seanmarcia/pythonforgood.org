### Attending Python for Good

Python for Good is a new annual event based out of the Portland area where Python programmers from all over the globe get together for a long weekend to build projects that help our communities. In 2018 the event will take place at Reed College. Participants will stay in on-site dorms with hacking and socializing takes place in communal areas. Join us Jul 26-29, 2018 for the fun of giving back!

###### How Does Python for Good Work?

The organizers of Python for Good work year round contacting and working with non-profits to find projects that are both within the scope of Python for Good and helpful to non-profit organizations and individuals. In 2018 projects are focused on helping families and children.

This is an event for people of *all* skill levels so even if you are new, don't let that prevent you from contributing! Attendees self-select into projects that are meaningful to them and the fun begins! Most projects have a need for a variety of skills including both developers and designers. You don't HAVE to be a Python programmer but it does help. We're more than happy to welcome programmers of other languages, especially if you're interested in learning some Python. :)

###### That Sounds Awesome, Tell Me More!

###### Interested in Leading a Team?

During registration we'll ask if you'd like to lead a team.  We'll be
in touch in early July with potential projects. We'll brief you on
expectations and put you in touch with your non-profit so you can work with them
in advance of the event to set up project requirements, milestones and initial
set up so you can hit the ground running with your team at Python for Good. Setup
includes creating a github repo under the Python for Good github, filing issues
and making some technology suggestions. If you want to know what it will be like
to lead a team this year, [read our team lead guide](/team-leads.html). For an
in-depth look at what it's like to lead a team, check out Brandon
