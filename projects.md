### Meet our projects!

We're so excited to work with our partner organizations. There's still time to
suggest a project if you have a [great one in mind](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDhmp0I_qW08biCxt0uMwvAkWmLvwkWefZ4_Yt9NgEASKBrA/viewform)!.

#### Sisters of the Road Cafe

[Sisters of the Road Cafe](http://sistersoftheroad.org/) is a nonprofit Cafe in
Portlandâ€™s Old Town neighborhood working to create systemic change that will end
poverty and homelessness forever by providing nourishing meals in a safe,
dignified space. We're partnering with them to help improve their system for
tracking volunteer hours and meal credits.

#### Know Your City

[Know Your City](http://knowyourcity.org/) engages the public in art and social
justice through creative placemaking projects. Our programs and publications aim
to educate people to better know their communities, and to empower them to take
action. We'll be helping them set up an interactive map of Portland that
highlights important historical and cultural sights that might otherwise go
unseen by residents and visitors alike.

#### Free Geek

[Free Geek](http://www.freegeek.org) seeks to narrow the digital divide through
computer hardware salvage and computer education. They give refurbished computers to
people willing to put in time handling electronics recycling, do hardware grants
for other non-profits, and teach free classes on everything from computer basics to
web development. We'll be helping them with a self-scheduling system for volunteers.

#### First Chesapeake

Studies have shown that if you engage children in STEM activities they are more likely to become inspired to pursue careers in STEM related fields. [First Chesapeake](https://www.firstchesapeake.org/) accomplishes this by engaging kids in exciting Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. We'll be helping them with a volunteer tracking system.

#### Mirror Foundation

Every child has the right to happiness and to grow up in a safe environment. Unfortunately, among the poor of northern Thailand, especially the hilltribes, this right is often not realized. The cities in northern Thailand are full of children who have left school as early as the fourth grade, to struggle earning money for their family. Worse yet, the extreme poverty of the region is fertile ground for those wishing to traffic women and children to wealthier areas of the country. The [Mirror Foundation](https://www.themirrorfoundation.org/themirrorfoundation/index.php/21-current-projects/project-to-combat-trafficking-in-women-and-children) is working to prevent this. We'll be helping them with a facial recognition application to help identify trafficked children.

#### Meta

Python for Good is a non-profit, too :) The organizers will be leading a very
informal team to work on the Python for Good website and brainstorm ideas for
future events. We strongly encourage attendees to consider our partner
non-profits' projects first, but feel free to drop by and give us any feedback
or ideas during the event.

#### More to come!

We're finalizing project ideas with organizations like the World Wildlife Fund,
PDX Resistance, and others. If you want to suggest a
project for us to work
on,
